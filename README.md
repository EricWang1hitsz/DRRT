# DRRT
Dynamic Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRTx)

Michael Otte wrote DRRT for the Julia programming language.
I am rewriting it using his code in C++ for the ARPG as a planner for the Ninja Car.

The ltlspec branch was created for a Computer-Aided Verification project at CU Boulder in the Fall of 2017.
It will read Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) specified instructions and construct motion plans that adhere to this specification while avoiding obstacles.
